# ADR 0008: Injected frontend packs

## Status

Accepted. Amends ADR 0007 — the clause "a pack never contributes code" no longer holds.

## Context

ADR 0007 shipped extension packs as pure data: `plugin.json` plus JSON/GLSL/images,
interpreted by engines already in the application. The stated reason for refusing
pack code was that running pack code in the webview "would give zero isolation".

That reasoning does not fit this product. CCZJ Video is single-user desktop software;
the "user" and the "attacker" are the same person, and that person already owns the
machine, the exe and the data directory. The restriction therefore protected nobody
while blocking the extensions the user actually wanted — every UI tweak needed a new
declarative `kind`, i.e. a new engine plus a release.

The requirement, restated: the user may modify anything the interface can express,
as long as the kernel stays intact.

## Decision

Add a fourth pack kind, `script`, and a cross-cutting `script` section any kind may
also carry. It names an entry file (`.js`/`.mjs`, ≤ 2 MiB) and optional stylesheets
(`.css`), both resolved inside the pack directory by the same path rules as every
other kind.

The frontend injects them after `app.mount('#app')`:

- Stylesheets become `<style>` elements in `document.head`.
- The entry is fetched as text through the existing `ReadPluginFile` binding and run
  as an ES module via a dynamic `import()` of a `blob:` URL. There is no CSP in this
  app and adding one is not on the roadmap, so this needs no relaxation. It is
  preferred over `eval` because the module gets a real module scope, and a fresh URL
  per pass means a rescan always observes edited source.
- The module's `setup` (or `default` function, or `default.setup`) receives a `cczj`
  object: the Wails binding namespace, the router, the Vue runtime exports, the nine
  Pinia stores, i18n (`t` / `merge` / `locale`), backend event subscription, a namespaced
  localStorage, the app log timeline, and five mount points — `nav`, `route`, `css`,
  `settingsTab`, `intercept`. `cczj.components` hands out the app's own `LogPanel` and
  `DiagnosticsPanel` so a pack can mount an existing panel instead of rebuilding one.

`intercept` is what makes "modify, not just extend" real: a pack can wrap a store
action and change behaviour, including not calling the original.

Four boundaries keep this off the kernel:

1. **Nothing reaches Go.** Packs run in the webview and can only call bindings that
   are already exported. ADR 0001 (table ownership, `source_key`) and every storage
   invariant are enforced server-side and stay enforced.
2. **Built-in routes cannot be overridden.** `route()` throws if the path already
   belongs to an app page. Replacing core UI requires editing core UI.
3. **Built-in settings groups cannot be claimed.** `settingsTab()` throws on the five
   ids the app owns (`basic` / `theme` / `extensions` / `advanced` / `about`); a pack
   adds a group, it does not seize one.
4. **Failure degrades to one pack.** A pack that throws has everything it registered
   this pass undone (routes, nav entries, styles, patches, subscriptions), is recorded
   as broken in `localStorage`, is skipped on later passes until the user hits retry,
   and writes one `ERROR` line to the log timeline. Other packs and built-in features
   are untouched. Every pass disposes the previous pass first, so a pack that vanished
   from disk cannot linger on screen.

## Consent, not isolation

Writes and outbound requests go through a prompt (`docs/plugins.md` §2.1). A pack
declares `write` and `network` in its manifest; Go validates the declaration and stores
nothing about consent. The gate lives in the frontend runtime:

- `cczj.bindings` is handed out behind a Proxy. Names that read (`Get…`, `List…`,
  `Search…`, plus an explicit list) pass through; everything else is a write and needs
  `write`. Callers still get a Promise, so no pack has to be rewritten.
- `fetch` is patched globally, but acts only when the current call stack contains a blob
  URL the runtime claimed for a pack **and** the target is not the app's own host.
  Requests to `wails.localhost` always pass: that is where Wails sends every binding call,
  so a pack calling any binding would otherwise be reported as "trying to reach the network"
  — that false positive blocked three packs on the first real run. The player's segment
  loop and every other app request is untouched, and the claim table is emptied when no
  pack is loaded so the common path costs nothing.
- `WebSocket` is deliberately not patched. Wrapping a native constructor means copying its
  statics, and `CONNECTING` is a non-writable data property inherited through the prototype
  chain — the assignment throws in strict mode, which is exactly how the first pack to
  trigger the install got isolated. Nothing in the pack API needs sockets, so it is out.
- Undeclared capability: refused without asking. Declared: one prompt on first use, then
  the answer is remembered in the settings KV (`plugin_permissions`) and shown on the
  extensions card, where revoking it returns that capability to "not asked yet".
  Every decision writes one line to the log timeline.

This is a consent mechanism, deliberately not a sandbox, and it is documented as such.
`XMLHttpRequest` is left alone because the playback engine uses it and gating it would
put the player behind a permission dialog; a pack determined to misbehave can also build
its own blob module and escape attribution, or reach the same writes through `cczj.stores`
— an app action imports its bindings directly and never passes through the proxy. What the
gate buys is that nothing reaches the library or the network without the user having seen
which pack did it — and that a sloppy pack fails loudly at the first call instead of
quietly rewriting the database.

## Dogfooding: the app's own panels are packs

Three packs ship inside the binary — `motion-effects`, `logs-panel` and
`diagnostics-panel` — and the Settings page no longer hardcodes those groups. The panel
components stay compiled into the app; the packs only call `settingsTab()` to hang them
on the group bar. The point is ownership of the decision: an item the user cannot remove
is a feature, one they can delete with the folder is a preference.

`motion-effects` goes one step further and carries a CSS layer (`motion.css`) holding the
app-wide motion tokens, so the knobs of the animation system live on disk where the user
can edit them. The reduced-motion fallback deliberately stays in the app: a switch the
pack exposes must not be stranded by turning the pack off.

Seed semantics are what makes that honest, and they are load-bearing:

- Built-in packs are written to `<dataDir>/plugins` **once**, guarded by a version
  marker file. Re-seeding on every start would make "delete the folder = uninstall"
  false for exactly the two packs the user is most likely to want gone.
- An existing pack directory is never overwritten, even when the marker is bumped, so
  editing a built-in pack survives — the app does not write into pack directories,
  built-in or otherwise.
- A version bump therefore only fills in packs that are genuinely missing.

Installing is now the same conversation in reverse: dropping a folder on the extensions
card reads the files in the webview, stages them under `<dataDir>/plugin-staging`, runs
the full manifest validation there, and only renames into `plugins/` if the pack is
`ready`. A failed drop leaves nothing behind, and a same-id pack is swapped with a
rollback path rather than clobbered. The drag is a convenience, not a bypass — every
rule in ADR 0007 still applies to what arrives.

## Consequences

- ADR 0007's "no sandbox, no permission model" consequence still holds in the sense that
  matters: nothing here contains a pack. `script` packs add a consent gate over the two
  actions the user can actually care about — changing app data and talking to the network
  — while everything inside the webview remains the user's own trust decision.
- Pack code is not isolated from pack code. Two packs may patch the same action;
  undo order (last registered, first undone) keeps a stack of wrappers from being
  torn down half-applied, but a pack that mutates another pack's output is the user's
  business, not something the runtime arbitrates.
- The runtime-only Vue build means packs cannot use `<template>` or SFCs; components
  are `h()` render functions, and the module cannot `import` anything. The `cczj`
  argument is deliberately wide so no gap forces a release.
- Production builds drop `console.log`, so `cczj.log` and the settings log panel are
  the observable channel for pack behaviour; injection failures are written there for
  the same reason.
- The declarative layer is unchanged: `source` / `shader` / `theme` still ship no code,
  so the copy-paste-and-go path stays available for anyone who does not want to write JS.
- Pack settings groups share one ordering scale with the built-in ones (10–70), so the
  two groups that became packs kept their positions and the Settings layout did not
  move. The group bar is reactive: if a pack disappears on rescan while the user is
  sitting on its group, the page falls back to `basic` rather than showing an empty panel.
- Uninstalling is a real delete: the card's button calls `UninstallPlugin`, which runs
  `os.RemoveAll` on the pack directory after a confirm dialog — no recycle bin, no
  backup copy kept by the app. The directory path comes from the scanned registry, and
  the call additionally requires the target to be a direct child of the plugins root
  containing a `plugin.json`, so a stale cache entry cannot be aimed at something else.
  Built-in packs are excluded by directory name on both sides: no button in the UI, and
  a refusal in Go. Removing one is still possible — by hand, from the folder — which is
  what keeps the seed semantics above honest.
